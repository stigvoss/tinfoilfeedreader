# Tinfoil

Tinfoil is a privacy-focused feed reader. The purpose is to enable users to create and consume custom collections of RSS feeds in the cloud without a requirement to creating an account or assign an personal identifier.

As an experiment and exercise, Tinfoil is built on Microsoft's preview version of ASP.NET Core Blazor framework. Blazor allows C# code to be run directly in the brower on WebAssembly and Mono.
